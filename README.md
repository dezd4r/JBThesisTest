# JBThesisTest
Hello, I did not have time to deal with the docker, in order to run this project you will need to additionally download the pygame and numpy libraries

## Local Build
``pip install pygame``

``pip install numpy``

``python3 main.py``

Once the program starts, you will need to enter a number of cells and the size of this cell in the console. After that a window with the game field will appear. The robot **CAN** be moved with the keyboard arrows, the coordinates of obstacles are displayed in the console.
